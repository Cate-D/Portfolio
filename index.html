      <p>Working with a partner, we created an Animal Shelter website to practice CSS cascading styles with inherited and nested child elements. We used columns for each animal's profile and practiced with specificity and how they affect CSS selectors, learned the advantages of CSS in place of inline styling, and changed styles of elements according to cascading precedence using the Mozilla Developer Network for different selectors and properties.</p>

        <p>This project encompasses a week's worth of beginning lessons on Bootstrap. Working with a partner we implemented several of the most common Bootstrap resources and styles. First we linked the Bootstrap style sheet, added a container to wrap our content nicely, added padding to dynamically adjust the page elements sizes depending on the user's viewport. We added a jumbotron and panels, and styled text with a blockquote and Bootstrap helper classes.</p>

        <p>This project is a site for a vacation I would like to go on. The intent of the project was to pracice Bootstrap components like, a container to pad all content, Jumbotron, blockquotes, and helper classes to add color that emphasizes certain areas of the page. In addition to bootstrap styles, page elements were organized in bootstraps grid and a CSS stylesheet to customize the appearance further.              <p>Languages used:</p>
